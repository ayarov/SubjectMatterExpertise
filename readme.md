## SME - Subject Matter Expertise
The following project aims to discover the editing behavior of the subject matter expert contributors in English Wikipedia.
Specifically, we try to distinguish between an SME editor behavior and other editors, even the anonymous by appliying generalization to our model.
In our research paper [TBD: reference] we describe the concrete definition of SME, as well as the entire process and conclusions.
We also state the limitation of this work and open a door for farther research.

All data used in this project is stored in a private S3 bucket.
